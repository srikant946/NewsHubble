# NewsHubble Android Application (Java)
An App which shows All those news releases are present at HubbleSite's news center, just by clicking on the desired news item we want to read :)

In the Emulator of Android Studio, this code would unfortunately run into some network issues, because of usage of API. So, I RECOMMEND IT TO BE INSTALLED ON A DEVICE IN-HAND.
